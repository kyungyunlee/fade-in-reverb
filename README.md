# Fade-in Reverberation 


### Setup
Use the `environment.yml` to install dependencies in the conda environment.

### Code
Main functions are under `fade_in_reverb` and notebooks under `notebooks` show use cases of these functions. 

### Data
Measurement dataset used in this paper is an omni channel version of the original full dataset. We used this version before the original dataset was released. It can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JTBwV-UZzwELUWNNWEk5OlxJC1GLgy80/view?usp=sharing) to reproduce the results from the paper. Credits to Karolina Prawda. 

If you want to work with the original full dataset, use this [link](https://zenodo.org/records/11388246). We also used this for the binaural demo. 

Treble simulation dataset has been introduced in this [paper](https://secure.aes.org/forum/pubs/conferences/?elib=22414) and was provided by the author. Availability will be updated in the future.
